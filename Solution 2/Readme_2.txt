**DATA GENERATION**
File Name= Data_Generation_2.ipynb

Equation of line used for this solution is y=mx+c .
Genetrating random values ranging from -10 to 10 and creating 1000 records.
Data is saved in Distance_file_2.csv format in working directory.

**NN MODEL**
File Name=NN_Model_2

Basic Sequential model is created to predict Distance.
Model is saved in NN_Model_2.h5 format in working directory.
"Distance" function is created for prediction on new data.
